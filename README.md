# megadots

My modular, flake-based repo for managing my systems using Nix and NixOS, flakes and Home Manager (as a NixOS module). I publish megadots to help others, as I found Github and other peoples repos (some shoutouts below!) extremely helpful to learn Nix/NixOS. Hopefully I can return the favour by publishing my own, for those who come after.

> **Note:** Though I use this repo for my own config, I also dabble and break things from time to time. I tend to keep working code in the `main` branch. Any other branch, assume it is a work in progress and not suitable for use. Also note that as this is my primary personal config, my `hardware-configuration.nix` files and attributes like `hostname`, `hashedPassword` and `username` will be unique to me, so you'll have to bring your own.

## Introduction

This is my personal system configuration repo that I use to build systems and homes in conjunction with NixOS, Home Manager and flakes. I started out this journey based on sheer curiosity and a desire to have a somewhat declaritive composition to system management (I distro hop - a lot). Some searching online lead me down the garden path that is NixOS, and here I am. Down the rabbit hole.

I am not an expert in Nix, NixOS, Home Manager or flakes. Nor am I a developer. Outside of my consultancy job (in a technical field so not completely in the dark), I'm a tinkerer. I'd been feeling a little burnt out and in need of something to learn in my downtime, and this project came along at the perfect time, and has genuinely brought some fun back in to computing for me. Just like the days of old, going to the local monthly computer market and picking up a fresh copy of a new Linux distro on a wad of floppies and taking it for a spin.

## Features
- **NixOS** system configuration on mulitple hosts.
- **Home Manager** user configuration for my user.
- **Impermanence** with LUKS encrypted btrfs snapshot and rollback.
- **Flakes** and modular configs.
- **Disko** for disk partioning and preperation.
- **Chaotic** inputs for CachyOS kernel.

## Usage

This configuration has a multiple system entry points, with Home Manager configured as a NixOS module. At the moment, I am a single user managing multiple machines (I expect this to grow).

### Getting Started

To deploy a configuration, you can use the `nixos-rebuild` command with the appropriate flake output. For example, to deploy the `endgame` configuration on the local machine:

```bash
# To build the configuration
nixos-rebuild build --flake .#endgame

# To test the configuration
nixos-rebuild test --flake .#endgame

# To apply the configuration
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#endgame
```

To deploy to a remote machine over SSH, you can use the `--flake` and `--target-host` flags:

```bash
nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#endgame --target-host velen2077@endgame --use-remote-sudo
```

### Customization

To adapt this configuration for your own use, you'll need to create a new host and user.

1.  **Create a new host directory** in `nixos/hosts`. You can copy an existing one (e.g., `nixos/hosts/nixvm`) as a template.
2.  **Generate a new `hardware-configuration.nix`** on the target machine with `nixos-generate-config`.
3.  **Update your `flake.nix`** to add a new `nixosConfigurations` entry for your new host.
4.  **Create a new user directory** in `home/` and a corresponding entry in `nixos/config/users`.
4.  **Create a new host file** in `home/$USER` for the Home Manager config for that specific host and user.

### Updating

To update the flake inputs (e.g., `nixpkgs`), run the following command:

```bash
nix flake update
```

## Hosts

| System | Description | Type | OS | CPU | GPU |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| endgame | My personal desktop | Custom build | NixOS | AMD Ryzen 7800X3D | AMD 9070XT |
| nixvm | My test VM | QEMU VM | NixOS | Host passthrough | OpenGL/3D accelerated |

I have a single user that I manage through Home Manager (velen2077). You may add additional users or rename mine to inherit my existing settings - though don't forget to change my hashedPassword to something of your own otherwise you won't be able to log in.

### File structure

I use the following structure to organise my configurations.

```

## mega-thanks

I learn by doing. None of this would be possible without the copious ammounts of developers and repos that share their content freely for others like me to disect and study. There are many, but to name a few - shout outs go to:

[ryan4yin](https://github.com/ryan4yin/) for their [awesome book](https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/) on NixOS (if you haven't started here, then give it a whirl - it really was great) and the [i3 Kickstarter repo](https://github.com/ryan4yin/nix-config/blob/i3-kickstarter/). Both excellent resources to help me understand the power of NixOS.

The majority of my config structure was heavily influenced by the awesome [Misterio77](https://github.com/Misterio77/). Not only did his [Nix Starter Configs](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs) help guide me early on, but his own [Nix Config](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-config/tree/main) repo was a great inspiration on how to construct and model a modular Nix configuration.
